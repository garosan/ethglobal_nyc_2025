# The Persistence of Memory (A Green App 🟢)

## Problem Statement

The Persistence of Memory is not a social network app but a social media utility. I recently lost my IG account and all of a sudden al my memories 🧠 and valuable content was gone. Traditional web3 social media tries to start from scratch but fails because of distribution or network effects. I want to solve the specific problem of creating a UX that let's users back up ⬆️, organize 📁 and attest ownership 🔑 of their mainstream social media content on-chain, opening the door for other use cases to build on top of it, like new combinations of famous apps or digital estate.
